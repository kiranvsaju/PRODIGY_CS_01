This Python program implements a Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. The program includes functions for both encryption and decryption. The caesar_cipher_encrypt function takes a message and a shift value, then shifts each letter in the message by the specified amount, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged. Similarly, the caesar_cipher_decrypt function reverses this process, shifting letters back by the specified amount to retrieve the original message. The main function provides an interactive command line interface, allowing users to choose whether to encrypt or decrypt a message, input the message, and specify the shift value. The program then displays the encrypted or decrypted message. This tool is useful for learning about basic cryptography and can be run in any Python 3.x environment. To use the program, simply run the script, follow the prompts to enter your message and shift value, and view the result. This project is a straightforward implementation of the Caesar Cipher, demonstrating fundamental concepts of string manipulation and user interaction in Python.
